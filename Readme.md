# How to register third-party and DevExtreme client-side libraries manually for Web Reporting widgets 

This example demonstrates how to include both the **Third\-Party** and **DevExtreme** libraries to an ASP.NET Web Forms web application **manually**. Our reporting web components require the following libraries:
- [jQuery 1.11.3+](http://jquery.com/)  
- [jQuery UI 1.10.3+](http://jqueryui.com/) (should include ***core***, ***widget***, ***mouse***, ***draggable***, ***resizable***, ***selectable*** modules, both JavaScript and CSS files)  
- [globalize v0.1.0](https://github.com/jquery/globalize) (Newer versions are not supported)  
- [knockout 3.0.0+](http://knockoutjs.com/)  (versions 3.5.0 and higher are not supported)

To register these libraries on the web page manually download and put them to the Scripts folder first. Then register them in the HTML page header section by using `<script\>` tags. **Note** that the order in which scripts are registered is important.
